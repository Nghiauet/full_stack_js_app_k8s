# This DaemonSet makes sure that a fluentd-elasticsearch pod runs on every node in your Kubernetes cluster. This is ideal for tasks such as log collection because it allows collection of data on every node without affecting application performance.

# In this Fluentd-Elasticsearch setup, Fluentd collects the log data and then it sends the logs to Elasticsearch, which is widely used for log analysis in Kubernetes environments.
